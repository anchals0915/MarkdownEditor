# Live Markdown Editor

## About 
A live Markdown editor is a tool that allows users to create, edit, and preview Markdown documents in real-time. 
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that uses plain text formatting syntax. 

A live Markdown editor enhances the writing and editing experience by providing a live preview of the rendered output as you type. 

## Features
+ Live Preview:
  -  The editor provides a real-time preview of the Markdown content being edited.
  -  As users type or make changes, they can see how the rendered output will appear.

+ Split View:
  - Some editors offer a split-screen view that shows the Markdown code on one side and the live preview on the other.
  - This allows users to see the changes in real-time as they edit the Markdown source.

- Syntax Highlighting:
  -  The editor highlights Markdown syntax to make it visually distinct and easier to read.
  -  This feature helps users identify different elements such as headings, lists, code blocks, etc.
  
- Toolbar or Shortcuts:
  - Editors may include a toolbar with buttons for common Markdown elements like bold, italic, headers, links, and lists.
  -  Keyboard shortcuts for these elements can also enhance the editing experience.
    
- Autosave:
  - An autosave feature ensures that changes are saved automatically at regular intervals, reducing the risk of data loss in case of unexpected events.

- Export Options:
  - The ability to export the Markdown document to various formats such as HTML, PDF, or other common document formats.
